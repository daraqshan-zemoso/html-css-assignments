    Annual eye and vision examinations are an important part of preventive health care.
    Many eye and vision problems have no obvious signs or symptoms.
    <br>As a result, individuals are often unaware that problems exist. Early diagnosis
    and treatment of eye and vision problems are important for maintaining good vision
    and eye health, and when possible, preventing vision loss.

    Our independent lines have their own character, their own charm, and their own stories.
    We have found that the quality of our independent frame lines to be superior to your average
    big box manufacturer.  <br>The eyewear we choose to carry is based on the quality of materials,
    craftsmanship and uniqueness.<br><br>

    If you have an eye disease or even the smallest of irregularities in your eye shape, you may have blurry
    vision at certain distances. <br>Vision testing allows us to determine how clearly youâ€™re seeing the different
    distances presented in the eye chart.<br> If you have a refractive error, the optometrist can dial in the suitable
    corrective lens prescription using a machine called a phoropter.
